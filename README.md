## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   - git clone https://github.com/emilbankov/angular-project-softuni

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   - cd your-repo

3. Open two separate terminals.

   3.1 In the first terminal (for the client), run the following commands:

       - cd client
       - npm install
       - ng serve

     This will install the client-side dependencies and start the development server.

   3.2 In the second terminal (for the server), run the following command:

       - cd server
       - node server.js

     This will start the server.

4. After running the client commands, you will see a message with a link to the local development server. Ctrl+click on the link in the terminal to open the website directly in your default web browser.

5. Folder Structure
   - client: Contains the client-side code (Angular app).
   - server: Contains the server-side code.
