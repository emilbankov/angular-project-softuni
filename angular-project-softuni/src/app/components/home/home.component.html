            device. Not all devices are eligible for credit. You must be at least 18 years old to be eligible to
            trade in for credit or for an Apple Gift Card. Trade-in value may be applied toward qualifying new
            device purchase, or added to an Apple Gift Card. Actual value awarded is based on receipt of a

            any trade-in transaction for any reason. More details are available from Appleâ€™s trade-in partner
            for trade-in and recycling of eligible devices. Restrictions and limitations may apply.
